# Writing a Tsunami detector

Welcome to the Tsunami community, we are thrilled that you want to contribute.
This guide will help you get started with writing a Tsunami detector.

There are several ways to write a Tsunami detector:

* [Using our custom configuration format]({{ site.baseurl }}/howto/new-detector/templated/00-getting-started) (preferred approach)
* [Using Java]({{ site.baseurl }}/howto/new-detector/new-detector-java)
* Using Python (not documented yet)

Note that by default we require every new detector written to use our custom
configuration format. If you think that the format does not meet the need for
your use case, feel free to raise it on the issue.
